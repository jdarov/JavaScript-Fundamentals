## Code Samples

Closure example:

    function makeCounter() {
      let count = 0;
      return () => ++count;
    }

    const counter = makeCounter();
    console.log(counter()); // 1
    console.log(counter()); // 2

Word count example:

    function wordCount(str) {
      return str.split(' ').reduce((acc, word) => {
        acc[word] = (acc[word] || 0) + 1;
        return acc;
      }, {});
    }

    console.log(wordCount('box car cat bag box'));
